## Introduction

The React Three.js T-Shirt Designer is a web application that provides a user-friendly interface for designing custom t-shirts. It leverages the power of React.js and Three.js to create an interactive 3D environment where users can customize their t-shirts with different colors and logos.

## Features

- Color selection: Users can choose from a wide range of colors for the t-shirt.
- Logo upload: Users can upload their own logos or choose from a library of pre-defined logos.
- AI image generation: The application uses DALEE (Deep Artificial Evolutionary Learning Engine) to generate AI images based on user input prompts.
- Real-time preview: Users can see a real-time preview of their customized t-shirt as they make changes.
- Save and share: Users can save and share their designs with others.

## Installation

To run the React Three.js T-Shirt Designer locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jareerzeenam/reactjs-threejs-tshirt-designing-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd reactjs-threejs-tshirt-designing-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies for both the client and server:

   ```
   npm run install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory under server folder and add your OpenAI API key:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

   You can obtain your OpenAI API key from [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

5. Start both the client and server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Usage

1. Select a t-shirt color: Use the color picker or select from the available color options to choose the base color for your t-shirt.

2. Upload a logo: Click on the "Upload Logo" button to upload your own logo image file or choose from the library of pre-defined logos.

3. Customize AI image: Fill in the input prompts for DALEE to generate an AI image based on your preferences. You can experiment with different prompts to get unique designs.

4. Preview and adjust: As you make changes to the t-shirt color, logo, or AI image, the real-time preview will update accordingly. Use this preview to visualize your design.

5. Save and share: Once you're satisfied with your design, you can save it and share it with others. Use the provided options to save the design as an image file or generate a shareable link.
